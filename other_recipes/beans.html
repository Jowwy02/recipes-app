    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Nigerian beans porridge, also known as stewed beans, is a dietary staple
      in many households in the country.<br />
      It is called “ewa riro” in Yoruba or sometimes just referred to as “ewa”,
      which means beans.<br />It is easily accessible to everyone and can be
      cooked without any fuss or a lot of added ingredients. It is a popular
      meal with students as it is a cheap way to feed a lot of people at once.
      Beans porridge can be prepared in different ways, usually as hearty, no
      fuss, “one pot” meal, but this recipe takes it from casual to
      extraordinary.
